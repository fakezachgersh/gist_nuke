# Dead simple way to clean up your gists

````
gem install gist_nuke
````

Currently, only range deletion is supported (will be adding more features soon)

When you have built up the courage to delete gists, run something like:

````
gist_nuke --deleterange 0,15
````

This will delete your first 15 gists.  Make the range as big or as small as you want!

Base level documentation when I am not in a rush I will definitely write up some more.
